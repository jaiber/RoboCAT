Here is a model implementation research analysis for RoboCat:

Architecture:
- RoboCat is based on the transformer architecture described in Gato (Reed et al. 2022). It uses a transformer decoder model to generate actions conditioned on observations and goal images.

- For image encoding, it uses a pretrained VQ-GAN (Esser et al. 2021) which encodes images into discrete tokens. The VQ-GAN was pretrained on ImageNet and other diverse image datasets.

- The core of RoboCat is an autoregressive transformer model that takes as input the tokenized proprioceptive observations, tokenized actions from the previous time steps, and the tokenized goal image. It is trained to predict the next action tokens.

- Additionally, the transformer is trained to predict future VQ-GAN encoded image tokens as an auxiliary self-supervised task. This is done by feeding the model output tokens through a linear layer to predict pixel values that are compared to future frame pixels.

Requirements for reproduction:

- VQ-GAN encoder pretrained on ImageNet and other image datasets 

- Proprioceptive observations and actions from robotic manipulation datasets covering multiple embodiments and tasks

- Goal images derived from end states of successful episodes in the datasets

- 1.18B parameter transformer architecture based on Gato with 24 layers and other hyperparameters specified in the paper

- AdamW optimizer with linear warmup and cosine decay learning rate schedule

- Auxiliary loss for predicting future image tokens encoded by VQ-GAN

- Stochastic depth and dropout regularization 

To reproduce RoboCat:

1. Pretrain VQ-GAN encoder on diverse image datasets 

2. Tokenize proprioceptive, action, and image sequences from robotic manipulation datasets 

3. Train the transformer model on these tokenized sequences with action token prediction and future image token prediction losses

4. Fine-tune on new tasks using limited expert demonstrations, also tokenized

5. Evaluate on held-out tasks and embodiments to measure generalization

6. Use fine-tuned RoboCat models to collect more experience on new tasks 

7. Retrain transformer on combined data to create improved RoboCat version

The key requirements are the VQ-GAN encoder, diverse robotic manipulation datasets covering multiple embodiments and tasks, the model architecture and training methodology described in the paper, and an iterative process of fine-tuning, data collection, and retraining for self-improvement. With these components, RoboCat could be reproduced.
