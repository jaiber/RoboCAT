# augment_trajectories_with_goal_images
Pseudocode

Define a function to augment tokenized trajectories with goal images.
For each tokenized trajectory in the dataset: a. If the trajectory is successful, select a goal image from the last image of another successful episode. b. If the trajectory is unsuccessful, use the last image of the same episode as the goal image.
Add the selected goal image to each time step of the tokenized trajectory.
Return the augmented tokenized trajectories.

```
def augment_trajectories_with_goal_images(tokenized_trajectories, success_detector):
    augmented_tokenized_trajectories = []

    for i, trajectory in enumerate(tokenized_trajectories):
        is_successful = success_detector(trajectory)

        if is_successful:
            # Select a goal image from the last image of another successful episode
            successful_episodes = [traj for j, traj in enumerate(tokenized_trajectories) if j != i and success_detector(traj)]
            goal_image = np.random.choice([traj[-1] for traj in successful_episodes])
        else:
            # Use the last image of the same episode as the goal image
            goal_image = trajectory[-1]

        # Add the selected goal image to each time step of the tokenized trajectory
        augmented_trajectory = [(x, I, goal_image, a) for x, I, a in trajectory]
        augmented_tokenized_trajectories.append(augmented_trajectory)

    return augmented_tokenized_trajectories
```

# Assuming tokenized_data is a list of tokenized trajectories
# and success_detector is a function that determines if a trajectory is successful
augmented_tokenized_trajectories = augment_trajectories_with_goal_images(tokenized_data, success_detector)
Copy code
In this code, we assume the existence of a success_detector function that determines if a trajectory is successful. This function would need to be implemented based on the specific details of the tasks and the dataset being used.





# Integrating vqgan + gato

The integration of the two models - VQGAN and GATO - in algorithmic pseudocode would be:

1. Initialize both the VQGAN and GATO models with their respective configurations and weight files.

2. Obtain images from data sources, which will be the input to the VQGAN model. 

3. Preprocess the images according to the needs of the VQGAN model.

4. Feed the preprocessed images to the VQGAN model. The VQGAN model will encode the images into a lower-dimensional space and return the encoded representations. 

5. Construct the tensor inputs for the GATO model. This includes tensor inputs for different types of embeddings and positional encodings.

6. Feed the encoded representations from the VQGAN model as input to the GATO model. 

7. The GATO model processes the inputs and returns the hidden states. These states can then be used for downstream tasks.

This pseudocode can be translated into the following Python code. Note: it might require some additional work in terms of connecting the outputs and inputs of the two models:

```python
# VQGAN setup
device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
vqgan = VQGAN_F8_8192(device)

# GATO setup
gato_config = GatoConfig.small()
gato = Gato(gato_config)

# Data collection
data_urls = [
    "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1592194996308-7b43878e84a6",
    "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582719508461-905c673771fd",
    # ...
]
preprocessed_data = vqgan.collect_and_preprocess_data(data_urls)

# Encode images with VQGAN
encoded_images = []
for img_tensor in preprocessed_data:
    z, _, [_, _, indices] = vqgan.model.encode(img_tensor)
    encoded_images.append(z)

# Prepare tensor inputs for GATO
input_dim = gato_config.input_dim
input_ids = torch.cat(encoded_images, dim=1)
# Other tensors (encoding, row_pos, col_pos, obs) need to be defined or calculated as in your original GATO setup

# Feed encoded images to GATO
hidden_states = gato((input_ids, (encoding, row_pos, col_pos), obs))
```

This code integrates the VQGAN and GATO models by feeding the output of the VQGAN model to the GATO model. Note that the input images are first preprocessed and encoded by the VQGAN model. The resulting encoded representations are then used as input to the GATO model. Other necessary tensors for the GATO model (encoding, row_pos, col_pos, obs) should be defined or calculated as per your application requirements.
